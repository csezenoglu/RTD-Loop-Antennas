Near field Propagation
======================

Within the near-field, propagation relation for electric-electric or magnetic-magnetic antennas (like antennas) is

.. math::

    \frac{P_{rx}}{P_{tx}} = \frac{G_{rx}G_{tx}}{4} \left( \frac{1}{(kr)^6} - \frac{1}{(kr)^4} + \frac{1}{(kr)^2} \right)

in which the ratio of received power :math:`P_{rx}` to transmitted power :math:`P_{tx}` follows from the transmit antenna gain :math:`G_{tx}`, the receive antenna gain :math:`G_{rx}`, the distance :math:`r` between antennas, and the wave number :math:`k=2\pi/\lambda` and wavelength :math:`\lambda` :cite:`richards:2010electrically`.
