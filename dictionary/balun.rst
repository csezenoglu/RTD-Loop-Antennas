Balun
=====

A balun (for balanced to unbalanced) is an electrical device that converts between a :ref:`balanced line <balanced-line>` (or signal) and an :ref:`unbalanced line <unbalanced-line>` (or signal). Transformer baluns can also be used to connect lines of differing impedance. `Read more from Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Balun&oldid=895949406>`_
