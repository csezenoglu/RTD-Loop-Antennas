Magnetic susceptibility
=======================

#Magnetic susceptibility is a dimensionless proportionality constant that indicates the degree of magnetization of a material in response to an applied magnetic field. A related term is magnetizability, the proportion between magnetic moment and magnetic flux density. A closely related parameter is the permeability, which expresses the total magnetization of material and volume.

#The volume magnetic susceptibility, represented by the symbol \chi_v (often simply \chi , sometimes \chi_m magnetic, to distinguish from the electric susceptibility), is defined in the SI units by the following relationship:

.. math::

    M=\chi H

Here

- M is the magnetization of the material (the magnetic dipole moment per unit volume), measured in amperes per meter,
- H is the magnetic field strength, also measured in amperes per meter.
- :math:`\chi` is therefore a dimensionless quantity.
