Balanced Line
=============

A balanced line or balanced signal pair is a transmission line consisting of two conductors of the same type, each of which have equal impedances along their lengths and equal impedances to ground and to other circuits. They are to be contrasted to :ref:`unbalanced lines <unbalanced-line>`, such as coaxial cable, which is designed to have its return conductor connected to ground, or circuits whose return conductor actually is ground. Balanced and unbalanced circuits can be interconnected using a transformer called a balun. `Read more from Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Balanced_line&oldid=899887757>`_
