Underwater Loop Reception
-------------------------

.. rst-class:: written

In the first world war, some submarines were equipped with radio signal receivers called "French" coils. An American submarine underwater at Long Island Sound received long-wave signals from Nauen, Germany in 1919 :cite:`toth:1950`.

Toth and Fratianni investigated underwater loop reception and concluded that these results: a) Long-distance underwater radio receivers should be used in the range of 15-30 kHz and about maximum of 6 m (20 ft). b) A convenient underwater receiver system should be omnidirectional and at a certain distance from the water surface :cite:`toth:1950`.

Induced voltage at the terminals of the antenna in the air is a function of the time of the frontwave that comes to the opposite edge of the coil that parallel to the electric vector. A similar induced voltage occurs at a loop antenna under water. However, since the wavelength of underwater wave propagation is much slower (1000 times slower than air) and the attenuation is too high, the phase differences of the induced voltages at the coil edges are high as shown in :numref:`induced-voltage-underwater` :cite:`toth:1950`.

The operation of the loop antenna under water significantly increases the efficiency of receiving. For example, in a 20 kHz system, the output voltage increased by 1650 times or 64 dB. However, there are losses in the field strenght of about 66 dB. The loss of the output voltage is only about 2 dB in the transmissions from above the water surface to just below the water surface. :numref:`attenuation-of-underwater` shows the amount of loss per foot under water :cite:`toth:1950`.
