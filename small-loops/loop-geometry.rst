Loop Geometry
=============

Dimensions
----------

For comparable performance, it appears that the length of the ferrite core must be roughly equal to the diameter of an equivalent air loop. However, other dimensions are smaller; that is, an air loop must be “large” in two dimensions, whereas a ferrite loop need be large in only one. The net result is a packaging advantage for the ferrite loop, somewhat less electrostatic pick-up than that for the air loop, and a structurally simpler device to electrostatically shield, if desired [Stewart, 1958].
The static measuring technique enables reasonably valid data to be accumulated at a rapid rate such that tests of ferrite-cored antennas covering a whole range of parameters can be obtained on a modest budget [Stewart, 1958].

Cylindrical cores longer than a solenoid winding are used to increase L for a given physical size. Cylindrical cores shorter than the solenoid winding and moved along the winding axis are used for L tuning with the greatest L occurring with the core centered [Serkan Aksoy, Mail, 04.04.2017].

Fundamental characteristics of the loop antenna radiation pattern (far field) are largely independent of the loop shape [Donohoe, ECE4990 Lecture Notes].

The far fields of an electrically small loop antenna are dependent on the loop area but are independent of the loop shape [Donohoe, ECE4990 Lecture Notes].

For any of the shapes given, there is less than 1% deviation between demagnetization factors of polygonal and circular cylinders for aspect ratios l_r/d_r above unity. For acicular particles (l_r/d_r  ~ 6.0) this deviation is less than 0.25% even for the most radical shape, the triangular cross-section [Moskowitz and Della Torre, 1966].

Size and shape of coils affect their high frequency resistance very broadly. Cross section of coil had little effect on the observed resistance [Witzig, 1947].
