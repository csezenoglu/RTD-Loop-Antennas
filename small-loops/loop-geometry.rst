Fundamental characteristics of the loop antenna radiation pattern (far field) are largely independent of the loop shape [Donohoe, ECE4990 Lecture Notes].

The far fields of an electrically small loop antenna are dependent on the loop area but are independent of the loop shape [Donohoe, ECE4990 Lecture Notes].

For any of the shapes given, there is less than 1% deviation between demagnetization factors of polygonal and circular cylinders for aspect ratios l_r/d_r above unity. For acicular particles (l_r/d_r  ~ 6.0) this deviation is less than 0.25% even for the most radical shape, the triangular cross-section [Moskowitz and Della Torre, 1966].

Size and shape of coils affect their high frequency resistance very broadly. Cross section of coil had little effect on the observed resistance [Witzig, 1947].
