Receiving Signal
================

Especially in metal detection systems, transmitter and receiver antennas are used together. Analyzing the signals generated by the receiver antenna is also an important issue.

Bai and Bai investigated an algorithm of digital metal detecting signal processing for the estimation of the size and type of metal that used in food safety and industrial production. In the absence of metal, it receives the induced signal as the reference vector and produces quadrature synchronous signal :math:`\sin\omega t` and :math:`\cos\omega t` then multiply to demodulation :cite:`bai:2018high`.
