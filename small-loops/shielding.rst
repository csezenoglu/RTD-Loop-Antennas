A practical version of a single-winding loop for test purposes is shown in Fig. 4.12. As a protection against electric field effects, the actual winding is additionally surrounded by a tubular metal shield that must have a slot at one point in order not to short-circuit the magnetic field :cite:`rohner:2006`
