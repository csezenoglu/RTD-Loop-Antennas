Magnetically Shielded Wire
**************************

A magnetically shielded wire (MSW), in other words magnetoplated wire (MPW), is generally a copper wire which has magnetic-conductive thin layers on the surface of the wire. Main advantage of this type of wire is that reduced eddy current losses due to the proximity effect. Thus, the AC resistance of the MSW coil is lower than standard wire coil :cite:`mizuno:2007reduction,fujita:2018finite`.

In order to calculate the eddy current losses in MSWs by the traditional finite element method (FEM), mesh must be generated sufficiently small elements from surface to center i.e. mesh elements must be smaller than the skin depth. This requires a high computating power. Fujita and Igarashi investigated finite-element analysis of MSW coils using homogenization method :cite:`fujita:2018finite`.
