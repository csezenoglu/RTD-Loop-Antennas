.. rubric:: Lock-in amplifier working principle

#Lock-in amplifiers use the knowledge about a signalâ€™s time dependence to extract it from a noisy background. A lock-in amplifier performs a multiplication of its input with a reference signal, also sometimes called down-mixing or heterodyne/homodyne detection, and then applies an adjustable low-pass filter to the result. This method is termed demodulation or phasesensitive detection and isolates the signal at the frequency of interest from all other frequency components. The reference signal is either generated by the lock-in amplifier itself or provided to the lock-in amplifier and the experiment by an external source :cite:`Zurich2016Principles`.

#The reference signal is usually a sine wave but could have other forms, too. Demodulation with a pure sine wave enables selective measurement at the fundamentalfrequency or any of its harmonics. Some instruments use a square wave which also captures all odd harmonics of the signal and, therefore, potentially introducing systematic measurement errors :cite:`Zurich2016Principles`.

    : Lock-in amplifiers are capable of measuring the amplitude and the phase of a signal relative to a defined reference signal, even if the signal is entirely buried in noise :cite:`Zurich2016Principles`.
