Resistance of Inductors
=======================

Reatti and Kazimierczuk investigated the AC resistance of an inductor. Several expressions in the literature for high-frequency winding resistance of inductors were reviewed and compared. In addition, an expression was presented to predict accurately both the high-frequency resistance and the quality factor of inductor. Equivalent circuit models of inductors in the literature were given as well :cite:`reatti:2002comparison`.
