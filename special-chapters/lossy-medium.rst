Power Loss
==========

Manteghi and Ibraheem investigated power loss of an electric and a magnetic dipole in a lossy medium. Near-field loss formulation was given and radiated power of antennas were also given. They concluded that magnetic antennas like loop antennas had *significant advantage* over electric field antennas such as dipoles regards to power loss in a lossy medium :cite:`manteghi:2014study`.
