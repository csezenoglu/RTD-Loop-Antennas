Human Detection
===============

Cechak investigated detection of human behind an obstacle with a loop antenna and a solenoid antenna (or inductive coil) in ELF band (3-30 Hz). He noted that human electromagnetic emissions in the ELF band is practically absent in the available literature. Both measurement results of loop and solenoid antennas were given in ELF band with human and no human :cite:`Cechak2007`.
