RFID
====

Turalchuk et al. investigated electrically small loop antennas for RFID applications. Two different condition were analyzed. Firstly, a receiving antenna was in the biological medium to link an implanted sensor and a transmitting (reader) antenna was outside of the medium. In this case, loops were operated in near-field zone in order to minimize effects of the dielectric properties of the biological medium. Secondly, a loop as a reader antenna for the identification of conventional tags in the far-field zone :cite:`turalchuk:2015electrically`.
