Biomedical Implant
==================

The environment in which biomedical implant devices are located is characterized by a *high dielectric permeability* and a *high loss factor* to disrupt the electromagnetic signal :cite:`turalchuk:2015electrically`.

Cheng et. al. investigated optimization of a solenoid type receiver coil for biomedical implants in order to create a WPT link. Analytical model of solenoid coil that includes the impact of tissue and coating around the coil was done. A four-turn coil had better results with 0.233 mm pitch at 700 MHz after a pitch optimization. An accurate formulation for the RLC model of implanted solenoid coil. The formulation was valid below self-resonance frequency of Rx coil :cite:`cheng2017:analytical`.
