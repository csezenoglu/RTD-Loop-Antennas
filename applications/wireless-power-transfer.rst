Wireless Power Transfer
=======================

Zhang et al. investigated a quadrature-shaped receiver (pickup) coil for omnidirectional wireless power transfer (WPT) as shown in :numref:`quadrature-shaped-pickup-zhang-2018`. A cross-shaped core is placed inside the receiver and the windings are wrapped around the core. Receiver is simulated for different geometric dimensions of the core and the results are presented in terms of both power and efficiency :cite:`zhang:2018optimal`.
