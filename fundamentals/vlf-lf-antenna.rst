VLF & LF Antenna
================

VLF (Very Low Frequency) Band take place from 3kHz to 30 kHz in the frequency spectrum :cite:`ekmekci:2004`.

	*	- Advantages
		- Disadvantages
		
	*	- EM waves penetrate more than higher frequencies such as in the sea water
		- High background noise levels
	
	*	- Low atmospheric attenuation
		- Communication needs large amount of power at the output of the transmitter
	
	*	- Appropriate for long range communication
		- 
	*	- Diffract around objects that would block higher frequencies
		-
	*	- Less prone to multipath

VLF antennas operate on VLF band. They are electrically small and this simplifies analysis. They are physically large structures. In other words, they generally have a number of towers that 200-300 m high and cover areas of up to a square kilometer or more. The VLF antennas support worldwide communication :cite:`ekmekci:2004`.

The VLF antennas have some problems that listed below :cite:`ekmekci:2004`:

- Bandwidth is less than 200 Hz.
- Small radiation resistance.
- They are expensive structures.
- Antenna system covers a large area.
- Designing an efficient transmitting antenna is difficult.
- High power levels are needed for transmission.

Marris produced a ferrite core loopstick antenna for receiving application as shown in :numref:`loopstick-ultima`. He said VLF antenna but operating frequency band is 50 kHz to 195 kHz, so it was a LF antenna. MMG F14 grade nickel-zinc material was used. The antenna compared with a traditional 20 x 1.25 cm diameter loopstick and he noted that increased signal strength and reduced noise :cite:`marris:1998ultima`.
