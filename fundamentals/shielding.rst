Shielding
=========

A practical version of a single-winding loop for test purposes is shown in Fig. 4.12. As a protection against electric field effects, the actual winding is additionally surrounded by a tubular metal shield that must have a slot at one point in order not to short-circuit the magnetic field :cite:`rohner:2006` 

Buie investigated the design and construction of a shielded receiving loop antenna. The designed antenna had approximately 60% increase in effective height and a 3 dB increase in terminal voltage over a conventional loop antenna. Capacitive loading of the shield gap was optimized at 14 - 34 kHz band and results were presented. In addition, optimum number of turns were optimized :cite:`buie:1963optimized`.
