Shielding
=========

A practical version of a single-winding loop for test purposes is shown in Fig. 4.12. As a protection against electric field effects, the actual winding is additionally surrounded by a tubular metal shield that must have a slot at one point in order not to short-circuit the magnetic field :cite:`rohner:2006` 

Buie investigated the design and construction of a shielded receiving loop antenna. The designed antenna had approximately 60% increase in effective height and a 3 dB increase in terminal voltage over a conventional loop antenna. Capacitive loading of the shield gap was optimized at 14 - 34 kHz band and results were presented. In addition, optimum number of turns were optimized :cite:`buie:1963optimized`.

Magnetic Shielding
------------------

Magnetic shielding can be made three different ways: high-permeability magnetic material, thick-walled conducting material or active compensation. Heinonen et. al., investigated a thick-walled conducting enclosure for biomagnetic measurements :cite:`heinonen:1980properties`. 

Commonly, high-permeability :math:`\mu`-metal is used on the magnetically shielded enclosures and it is convenient from DC to radio-frequencies. However, :math:`\mu`-metal is very sensitive to mechanical vibrations and degradation of permeability in mechanical stress. 

The advantages of thick-walled conducting material are low price, easy and rigid construction. Its main disadvantage is that the attenuation is zero for static field and increasing function of frequency :cite:`heinonen:1980properties`.
