Electromagnetic Spectrum
========================

The electromagnetic spectrum is the range of frequencies (the spectrum) of electromagnetic radiation and their respective wavelengths and photon energies :cite:`wiki:electromagnetic`.

Radio Spectrum
--------------

International Telecommunication Union (ITU) divides the radio spectrum into 12 bands, each beginning at a wavelength which is a power of ten (10:sup:`n`) metres, with corresponding frequency of 3×10:sup:`8−n` hertz, and each covering a decade of frequency or wavelength :cite:`wiki:radiospectrum`.
