Fratianni investigated the effect of iron cores on the receiving efficiency of VLF loop antennas, in air and underwater [Fratianni, 1950].

Rumsey and Weeks investigated electrically small, ferrite loaded loop antennas. Approximate formulas have been developed for the impedance, efficiency, and Q of electrically small, ferrite-loaded loop antennas. The formulas are based on an assumed knowledge of these parameters for the antenna without ferrite loading. Radiation resistance formulation is also given [Rumsey and Weeks, 1956]. 

Devore and Bohley investigated an analytical model of a class of electrically small multiturn loop antennas has been formulated and compared with experimental measurements over a frequency range of 3 to 86 MHz. Both air core and magnetically loaded cases were examined. The analytical model described in this paper should prove an effective design aid for a volumetrically constrained antenna of the class [Devore and Bohley, 1977].

Burton et. al. investigated the electromagnetic field of an electrically small loop antenna with a cylindrical core. The infinitely long cylinder may be conducting or insulating. With the help of the principle of similitude, measurements made with a small loop at a high frequency with cylinders of water with widely different conductivities are applied to a very large loop around a mountain at a very low frequency. An approximate equivalent circuit for the loop with a core is described and tested [Burton et. al., 1983].

The goal of this research is to develop and validate a low-frequency modeling code for high-moment transmitter rod antennas to aid in the design of future low-frequency TX antennas with high magnetic moments. modeling code can predict the TX antennaâ€™s gain, maximum magnetic moment, saturation current, series inductance, and core series loss resistance, provided the user enters the corresponding complex permeability for the desired core magnetic flux density [Jordan et. al., 2009].
