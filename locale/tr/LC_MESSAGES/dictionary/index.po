"collecting area known as the effective aperture. This may be associated "
"with a physical aperture but even a linear wire antenna can be described "
"in terms of a notional collecting area. If the electromagnetic field has "
"a power density of :math:`P_d`, and the receiving antenna has an "
"effective aperture of :math:`A_e` then it will capture a power of "
":math:`P_d A_e`. The effective area depends only on the wavelength of the"

"#In electrical engineering and telecommunications the Chu–Harrington "
"limit or Chu limit sets a lower limit on the Q factor for a small radio "
"antenna. The theorem was developed in several papers between 1948 and "
"1960 by Lan Jen Chu, Harold Wheeler, and later by Roger Harrington. The "
"definition of a small antenna is one that can fit inside a sphere of "
"radius :math:`k^{-1}`, where :math:`k=2\\pi /\\lambda` is the wavenumber."
" For a small antenna the Q is proportional to the reciprocal of the "
"volume of a sphere that encloses it. In practice this means that there is"
" a limit to the bandwidth of data that can be sent to and received from "
"small antennas such as are used in mobile phones."

"where :math:`a` a is the radius of the smallest sphere containing the "
"antenna and its current distribution. A circular polarized antenna can be"
" half the size. (an extension of the theory of Chu by Harrington). As "
"antennas are made smaller, the bandwidth shrinks and radiation resistance"
" becomes smaller compared to loss resistances that may be present, thus "
"reducing the radiation efficiency. For users this decreases the bitrate, "
"limits range, and shortens battery life. "

"#Magnetic torquer rods (also known as torquers, torque rods, torque bars,"
" torqrods, or magnetorquers) are widely used as attitude control system "
"(ACS) actuators for geostationary satellites, small satellites, and "
"microsatellites. A magnetic torquer rod is essentially a long copper wire"
" wound around a core. The core material could be special alloys or simply"
" air. With a metal core, the magnetic torquer rod can generate a larger "
"magnetic dipole moment at the expense of a larger residual moment as "
"compared with the air-core type. Magnetic torquer rods are designed to "
"generate controllable magnetic dipole moments that interact with the "
"Earth’s magnetic field and generate torques for active attitude control "
"purposes for spacecraft (Sidi, 1997;Wertz, 1978). Torque Tmag of a "
"magnetic torquer is given by the cross product of its magnetic dipole "
"moment M and the Earth’s magnetic-field vector B, i.e., Tmag = M × B. "
"Magnetic control systems have the characteristics of relatively light "
"weight and require no moving parts, expendables, or complex hardware."
