"The most convenient geometrical arrangement for the field analysis of a "
"loop antenna is to position the antenna symmetrically on the :math:`x-y` "
"plane, at :math:`z = 0`. The wire is assumed to be very thin and the "
"current is assumed to be constant. A constant current distribution is "
"accurate only for a loop antenna with a very small circumference "

"In the analysis of radiation problems, the usual procedure is to specify "
"the sources and then require the fields radiated by the sources. It is a "
"very common practice in the analysis procedure to introduce auxiliary "
"functions, known as vector potentials, which will aid in the solution of "
"the problems. The most common vector potential functions are the "
":math:`A` (magnetic vector potential) and :math:`F` (electric vector "
"potential). While it is possible to determine the :math:`E` and :math:`H`"
" fields directly from the source-current densities :math:`J` and "
":math:`M`, as shown in "
":numref:`geometrical_arrangement_for_loop_antenna_analysis`, it is "
"usually much simpler to find the auxiliary potential functions first and "
"then determine the :math:`E` and :math:`H`. This two-step procedure is "
"also shown in :numref:`geometrical_arrangement_for_loop_antenna_analysis`"
" :cite:`balanis:2005`."
