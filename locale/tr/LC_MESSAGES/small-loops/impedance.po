"In 1973 Wait and Spies investigated low-frequency input impedance of a "
"circular loop over a conducting medium as shown in :numref:`loop-"
"impedance-with-conducting-earth`. Impedance equation was given and "
"calculated numerically. The impedance of the loop was analysed in terms "
"of wire and loop radius, skin depth and loop height from ground. The "
"limiting value of :math:`R` for the rate of loop radius to skin depth "
"(:math:`a/\\delta`) tending towards infinity was noted "
":cite:`wait:1973low`."
