"In the case of loop antennas, the dipole consists of a usually circular "
"or rectangular current loop which acts like a coil and functions in "
"response to the magnetic component of the electromagnetic field "

"A small loop (circular or square) is equivalent to an infinitesimal "
"magnetic dipole whose axis is perpendicular to the plane of the loop. "
"That is, the fields radiated by an electrically small circular or square "
"loop are of the same mathematical form as those radiated by an "
"infinitesimal magnetic dipole :cite:`balanis:2005`."
