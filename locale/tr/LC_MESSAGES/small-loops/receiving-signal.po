"Bai and Bai investigated an algorithm of digital metal detecting signal "
"processing for the estimation of the size and type of metal that used in "
"food safety and industrial production. In the absence of metal, it "
"receives the induced signal as the reference vector and produces "
"quadrature synchronous signal :math:`\\sin\\omega t` and "
":math:`\\cos\\omega t` then multiply to demodulation "
