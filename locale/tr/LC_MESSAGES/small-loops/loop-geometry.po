"For comparable performance, it appears that the length of the ferrite "
"core must be roughly equal to the diameter of an equivalent air loop. "
"However, other dimensions are smaller; that is, an air loop must be "
"“large” in two dimensions, whereas a ferrite loop need be large in only "
"one. The net result is a packaging advantage for the ferrite loop, "
"somewhat less electrostatic pick-up than that for the air loop, and a "
"structurally simpler device to electrostatically shield, if desired "
"[Stewart, 1958]. The static measuring technique enables reasonably valid "
"data to be accumulated at a rapid rate such that tests of ferrite-cored "
"antennas covering a whole range of parameters can be obtained on a modest"
" budget [Stewart, 1958]."

"Cylindrical cores longer than a solenoid winding are used to increase L "
"for a given physical size. Cylindrical cores shorter than the solenoid "
"winding and moved along the winding axis are used for L tuning with the "
"greatest L occurring with the core centered [Serkan Aksoy, Mail, "
"04.04.2017]."
