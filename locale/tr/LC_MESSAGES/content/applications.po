"In the first world war, some submarines were equipped with radio signal "
"receivers called \"French\" coils. An American submarine underwater at "
"Long Island Sound received long-wave signals from Nauen, Germany in 1919 "

"Toth and Fratianni investigated underwater loop reception and concluded "
"that these results: a) Long-distance underwater radio receivers should be"
" used in the range of 15-30 kHz and about maximum of 6 m (20 ft). b) A "
"convenient underwater receiver system should be omnidirectional and at a "
"certain distance from the water surface :cite:`toth:1950`."

"Induced voltage at the terminals of the antenna in the air is a function "
"of the time of the frontwave that comes to the opposite edge of the coil "
"that parallel to the electric vector. A similar induced voltage occurs at"
" a loop antenna under water. However, since the wavelength of underwater "
"wave propagation is much slower (1000 times slower than air) and the "
"attenuation is too high, the phase differences of the induced voltages at"
" the coil edges are high as shown in :numref:`induced-voltage-underwater`"
" :cite:`toth:1950`."

"The operation of the loop antenna under water significantly increases the"
" efficiency of receiving. For example, in a 20 kHz system, the output "
"voltage increased by 1650 times or 64 dB. However, there are losses in "
"the field strenght of about 66 dB. The loss of the output voltage is only"
" about 2 dB in the transmissions from above the water surface to just "
"below the water surface. :numref:`attenuation-of-underwater` shows the "
"amount of loss per foot under water :cite:`toth:1950`."
