"Islam noted that vector potential of a loop antenna that wrapped around "
"the finite cylinder core is very difficult due to the complexity at the "
"end of the cylinder [Islam, 1963]."

"difficult and the closest approach was the ellipsoid core loop antenna. "

"A magnetic core is a piece of magnetic material with a high magnetic "
"permeability used to confine and guide magnetic fields in electrical "
"devices. It is made of ferromagnetic metal such as iron, or "
"ferrimagnetic compounds such as ferrites. The high permeability, "
"relative to the surrounding air, causes the magnetic field lines to be "
"concentrated in the core material [wiki]."

"The use of a magnetic core can increase the strength of magnetic field "
"in an electromagnetic coil by a factor of several hundred times what it "
"would be without the core. However, magnetic cores have side effects "
"which must be taken into account. In alternating current (AC) devices "
"they cause energy losses, called core losses, due to hysteresis and eddy "
"currents in applications such as transformers and inductors. \"Soft\" "
"magnetic materials with low coercivity and hysteresis, such as silicon "
"steel, or ferrite, are usually used in cores [wiki]."

"For the purpose of expressing material properties and design relations "
"it is convenient to consider only sinusoidal wave forms. Ferrite cores "
"are often used at quite low amplitudes. At these low amplitudes the non-"
"linearity between :math:`B` and :math:`H` is small so that, to a first "
"order, the waveform distortion may usually be neglected. Under these "
"conditions, if the field strength is sinusoidal then the flux density "
"and the e.m.f. (proportional to :math:`dB/dt`) may be taken as "
"sinusoidal. Thus simple a.c. theory may be used to describe the "
"influence of a magnetic material on an electric circuit [snelling]."
