"The impedance in the antennaâ€™s main RLC circuit is not well matched to 50"
" :math:`\\Omega`. The induced voltage is highly reflected if connected "
"directly to a 50 :math:`\\Omega` input. One way to improve the matching "
"is to use a secondary coil or a so called pick-up coil next to the main "
"coil [Koskimaa, 2016]."

"Bachman investigated a low-impedance loop with coupling transformer and "
"explained the transformer parameters in terms of the circuit and "
"transformer coupling coefficients in 1945. The gain of the transformer "
"coupled loop system was analysed. The low-impedance transformer-coupled "
"loop and a high-impedance loop connected directly to the same tuning "
"capacitor was compared. He concluded that an ideal transformer-coupled "
"loop has 38.4% of the gain from a direct-connected loop of the same area,"
" assuming the same Q in the transformer secondary as in the direct "
"connected loop. In :numref:`transformer-coupling-low-impedance` the low-"
"impedance loop coupling-transformer circuit was shown "

"coupled cases with regard to signal-to-noise ratio. Only two transformer-"
