"#According to electromagnetic induction principle, alternate current "
"produces alternate magnetic field. The metal produces alternate eddy "
"current when it is in alternate magnetic field. The eddy current then "
"produces secondary magnetic field and react to original alternate "
"magnetic field by changing its amplitude and phase [c]."

"Rabinovici and Kaplan investigated an eddy current effect which occurs in"
" nonlinear magnetic conductors excited by multiple alternating fields in "
"1983. The field penetrating into the material contains new magnetic "
"fields whose frequencies is much lower than the frequencies of the "
"exitation fields. They noted that this is due to the realtive "
"cancellation (filtering) of the orginally high frequency fields by the "
"screening of eddy currents :cite:`rabinovici:1983`."

"In 1985, Kaplan and Rabinovici investigated an **eddy current sensor** "
"for DC and low-frequency magnetic fields as shown in :numref:`eddy-"
"current-sensor`. This new sensor based on multifield eddy current effects"
" could measure fields with intensities about :math:`10^{-5}` Oe or Gauss "
":cite:`kaplan:1985`."
