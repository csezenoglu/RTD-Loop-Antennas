"Cheng et. al. investigated a small solenoid coils for millimeter-sized "
"biomedical implants. This paper focuses on the optimization of the "
"solenoid-type Rx coils. Analytical model of solenoid coils that includes "
"the impact of tissue and coating around the coils. Optimal operating "
"frequency for the Rx and number of turns are found to be 500 MHz and 6, "
"respectively for the wireless power transfer. A significantly more "
"accurate formulation for the implanted solenoid coil lumped RLC model is "
"devised, which is valid at the frequencies lower than the Rx coil self-"
"resonance frequency (SRF), where L, R_s, C_p and R_p are the inductance, "
"parasitic series resistance (due to conductor’s ohm loss), parasitic "
"capacitance, and parasitic parallel resistance (due to dielectric loss in"
" the coating and tissue), respectively [Cheng et. al., 2017]."
