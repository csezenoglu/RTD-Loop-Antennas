"From the agreement between the theoretical results and our experimental "
"data, Fraga et. al. can conclude that the capacitance effect is quite "
"small for the measured solenoids at frequencies below 100 kHz [Fraga et. "
"al., 1998]."

"The operation of the antenna can be analyzed by using an equivalent "
"circuit. The ferrite rod antenna consists of a coil which can be modeled "
"as an inductor that has various resistances in series due to the antenna "
"losses. Together with a parallel capacitance the antenna forms a parallel"
" RLC circuit. The RLC resonance frequency can be tuned by adjusting the "
"capacitance of the capacitor. The impedance seen from the antenna "
"terminals is the antenna impedance [Koskimaa, 2016]:"
