"In view of their small dimensions the current in the entire loop can be "
"regarded as locally constant. Consequently, they generate the same sort "
"of field as a Hertzian dipole, i.e. a very short electrical antenna on "
"which the current distribution is a function of position to an equally "
"small extent :cite:`rohner:2006`. The field pattern of electrically "
"small antennas of any shape is similar to that of an infinitesimal "
"dipole :cite:`balanis:2005`."

"They have become less significant as transmitting antennas for "
"frequencies below 30 MHz. An exception to this is the tuned transmitting "
"loop, which can be equipped with a remotely controlled capacitor to make "
"a resonant circuit (a receiving loop can be provided with additional "
"selectivity and sensitivity in the same way). However, such loops are "
"extremely narrowband systems and therefore have to be retuned whenever "
"the frequency is changed :cite:`rohner:2006`."
