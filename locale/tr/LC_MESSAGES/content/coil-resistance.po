"The resistances in the antenna are divided into ohmic losses and the "
"radiation resistance. Ohmic losses in the antenna are caused by losses in"
" the wire itself and losses in the ferrite core. Increased losses lead to"
" the antenna being less sensitive at the resonant frequency. The half-"
"power bandwidth also becomes wider [Koskimaa, 2016]."

"K_Ï„ is an empirical constant. When a coil is used at a frequency near its"
" resonant frequency, its resistance is modified by its self-capacitance. "
"This self-capacitance increases the circulating current flowing in the "
"coil and hence gives rise to a greater coil loss. Apparent coil "
"resistance can be shown as [Witzig, 1947]"

"The **skin effect** is caused by eddy currents in the conductor. A "
"current flowing in a conductor creates a magnetic field around it. "
"Magnetic field induces circular eddy currents that oppose the change in "
"the magnetic field. This leads to the eddy currents being in the opposite"
" direction of the original current flow in the center of the conductor. "
"Near the surface or skin of the conductor the eddy currents flow in the "
"original current direction. Most of the current now flows near the "
"conductor surface thus the effective conducting area is reduced."
