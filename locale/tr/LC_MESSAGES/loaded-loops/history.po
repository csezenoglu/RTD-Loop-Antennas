"Rumsey and Weeks investigated electrically small, ferrite loaded loop "
"antennas. Approximate formulas have been developed for the impedance, "
"efficiency, and Q of electrically small, ferrite-loaded loop antennas. "
"The formulas are based on an assumed knowledge of these parameters for "
"the antenna without ferrite loading. Radiation resistance formulation is "
"also given [Rumsey and Weeks, 1956]."

"A general discussion relating to the application of small loop antennas "
"with air and ferrite cores k given. A general procedure for simplified "
"testing of ferrite-loaded magnetic type small antennas is outlined in "
"which radiofrequency radiation performance is expressed in tern of "
"quantities easily measured at audio frequencies. Only a single "
"measurement is needed to characterize the elementary-dipole type ferrite-"
"loaded antenna. Finally, a number of measurement results are given which "
"apply to the usual rod-type ferrite-loaded loop antenna: measurement "
"parameters cover a broad range of core lengths and diameters. It is found"
" that typical ferrite-loaded loops have little electrical advantage over "
"air loops although the packaging advantage of ferrite loops may be "
"significant [Stewart, 1958]."

"Devore and Bohley investigated an analytical model of a class of "
"electrically small multiturn loop antennas has been formulated and "
"compared with experimental measurements over a frequency range of 3 to 86"
" MHz. Both air core and magnetically loaded cases were examined. The "
"analytical model described in this paper should prove an effective design"
" aid for a volumetrically constrained antenna of the class [Devore and "
"Bohley, 1977]."

"Burton et. al. investigated the electromagnetic field of an electrically "
"small loop antenna with a cylindrical core. The infinitely long cylinder "
"may be conducting or insulating. With the help of the principle of "
"similitude, measurements made with a small loop at a high frequency with "
"cylinders of water with widely different conductivities are applied to a "
"very large loop around a mountain at a very low frequency. An approximate"
" equivalent circuit for the loop with a core is described and tested "
"[Burton et. al., 1983]."

"The goal of this research is to develop and validate a low-frequency "
"modeling code for high-moment transmitter rod antennas to aid in the "
"design of future low-frequency TX antennas with high magnetic moments. "
"modeling code can predict the TX antennaâ€™s gain, maximum magnetic moment,"
" saturation current, series inductance, and core series loss resistance, "
"provided the user enters the corresponding complex permeability for the "
"desired core magnetic flux density [Jordan et. al., 2009]."
