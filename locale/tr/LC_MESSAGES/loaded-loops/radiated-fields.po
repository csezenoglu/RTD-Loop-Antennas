"Islam introduced a solution for retarded vector potential of a permeable "
"*infinitely-long cylinder* loaded circular loop that is derived from "
"Maxwell’s equations. Islam also noted that vector potential of a loop "
"antenna that wrapped around the finite cylinder core is very difficult "
"due to the complexity at the end of the cylinder. Resulting vector "
"potential consisted of two parts: first part of potential was from loop "
"alone and the other part was from the permeable core "

"Islam then investigated methods of obtaining the electromagnetic field "
"quantities (magnetic vector potential) due to a circular loop of current "
"surrounding a *prolate spheroidal core*. First, static case was handled "
"and then time-varying case was discussed :cite:`islam:1963mathematical`."

"#The field generated by J in the presence of core is the same as the "
"superposition of the fields generated in the absence of the core by J and"
" the volume density of magnetic dipoles (or currents) jω(μ-μ_0)H, where H"
" is the magnetic field generated by J in the presence of the core and mu "
"and mu0 are the permeabilities of the core and free space respectively "
"[Rumsey and Weeks, 1956]."

"#Harmon investigated electric and magnetic fields of an empty solenoid at"
" frequency up to 100 MHz. Inside and outside the solenoid are separated. "
"The expressions for the field components are simplified if the frequency "
"is less than 100 Mhz [Harmon, 1991]."
