"The loops are rarely used as transmitting antennas above low levels of "
"power due to their poor radiation efficiency (low radiation resistance). "
"As transmitting antennas, they become less significant below 30 MHz. If "
"the efficiency is not an issue and power levels are very low, they are "
"used as a transmitter. Because they would soon become very hot when any "
"reasonable levels of power are fed into them, they must be cooled (for "
"example by water as in torpedo transmitter)."

"Above 20 MHz or so, ferrite losses increase to the extent that ferrite "
"loops may not be as good as air loops; relatively loss-free ferrites at "
"higher frequencies tend to have low permeability and hence the slight "
"advantage obtained with ferrites at low frequencies tends to disappear "
"[Stewart, 1958]. At a moderate distance R from the dipole, provided R is "
"large compared to dipole dimensions, and in the static case (that is, in "
"the audio frequency region), k/R2 and k2/R are very small relative to "
"l/R3 and hence can be ignored by comparison. This permits a static "
"measurement of magnetic field intensity to be made in order to find "
"dipole moment. Then radiation at some radio frequency can be determined "
"providing that the dipole moment does not change from static to radio "
"frequencies and providing the dipole is small enough to still be "
"considered an elementary dipole at the radio frequency of interest "
"[Stewart, 1958]."

"Direct radio-frequency measurements usually require that the magnetic "
"dipole antenna be electrostatically shielded; otherwise, incidental "
"electric dipole radiation makes it almost impossible to separate "
"radiation into electric and magnetic types. With static magnetic "
"measurements of a radio-frequency antenna, on the other hand, antenna "
"inductance is so small that no appreciable voltage is required to obtain "
"antenna driving current and hence no significant electric dipole moment "

"An unshielded magnetic dipole at radio frequencies will radiate to a "
"certain extent as an electric dipole. As a result, radiated power will "
"exceed that calculated for magnetic dipole radiation alone. Electric "
"dipole radiation typically affects radiation intensity most where the "
"magnetic dipole radiation is a minimum; in the case of the loop, the "
"major effect is to fill in the nulls. Magnetostatic measurements cannot "
"account for electric dipole radiation; hence, magnetostatically predicted"
" radio-frequency radiation resistance may be somewhat less than actual "
"radiation resistance if the magnetic-type antenna is unshielded [Stewart,"
