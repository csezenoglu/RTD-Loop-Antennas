"A magnetic core is a piece of magnetic material with a high magnetic "
"permeability, high electrical resistivity, low coercive field strength, "
"and low core loss used to confine and guide magnetic fields in electrical"
" devices. It is made of ferromagnetic metal such as iron or soft magnetic"
" alloys, or ferrimagnetic compounds such as ferrites. The high "
"permeability, relative to the surrounding air, causes the magnetic field "
"lines to be concentrated in the core material "

"By using a magnetic core, the magnetic field strength inside the coil can"
" be increased by a hundred times. However, magnetic cores have some side "
"effects to consider. In alternating current applications such as "
"transformers and inductors, they cause core losses due to hysteresis and "
"eddy currents. Usually, soft magnetic materials with low coercivity and "
"hysteresis such as silicon steel or ferrite are used "

"#When we construct coils like these we must consider that they haven't an"
" ideal behavior. The graph on the left shows that the apparent magnetic "
"permeability of a cylindrical core can be different from the magnetic "
"permeability of the metal of which is made. In fact the apparent "
"permeability depends on the geometric dimensions of the core, in "
"particular on the lenght-to-diameter ratio. So before buying the metal "
"for the core we must ensure that we can made the core with the right "
"lenght-to-diameter ratio to get from it all the permeability that can "

"#A variable magnetic field in a conductor material makes currents to "

"our core absorbing part of the signal we want to receive. There is no "
"possibility to eliminate this phenomenon, but it can be limited. The only"
" way is to \"cut\" this currents by using materials with a high internal "
"resistance (composite alloys) or to build the core with many little "
"pieces of metal (bars or laminations) insulated from each other. The "
"magnetic steel I used is sell in insulated foils, so, to build my core, I"
" simply put many of these together trying to obtain a cylindrical shape "
"to completely fill the free space inside the coil. The procedure is also "
"well shown by Hans Michlmair in his article ."

"#For the purpose of expressing material properties and design relations "
"it is convenient to consider only sinusoidal wave forms. Ferrite cores "
"are often used at quite low amplitudes. At these low amplitudes the non-"
"linearity between :math:`B` and :math:`H` is small so that, to a first "
"order, the waveform distortion may usually be neglected. Under these "
"conditions, if the field strength is sinusoidal then the flux density and"
" the e.m.f. (proportional to :math:`dB/dt`) may be taken as sinusoidal. "
"Thus simple a.c. theory may be used to describe the influence of a "
"magnetic material on an electric circuit [snelling]."
