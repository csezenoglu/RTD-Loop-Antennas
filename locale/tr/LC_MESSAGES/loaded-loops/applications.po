"Zhang et al. investigated a quadrature-shaped receiver (pickup) coil for "
"omnidirectional wireless power transfer (WPT) as shown in :numref"
":`quadrature-shaped-pickup-zhang-2018`. A cross-shaped core is placed "
"inside the receiver and the windings are wrapped around the core. "
"Receiver is simulated for different geometric dimensions of the core and "
"the results are presented in terms of both power and efficiency "
