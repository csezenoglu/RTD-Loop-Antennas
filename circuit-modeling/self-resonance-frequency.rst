Self Resonance Frequency
========================

Payne investigated self resonance frequency of coils and relationship of inductance, resistance, and Q factor of the coils. Derived equations of resistance, inductance, and Q factor were given. In addition, discussion of self capacitance was presented :cite:`payne:2014self`.
